                <h2>What is poly?</h2>

                <p>
                    Poly (short for polyamory) is an umbrella term used to describe a wide range of Ethical Non-monogamous relationship styles. Ethical Non-monogamy (ENM) is any form of relationship where all parties agree to having multiple sexual and/or romantic partners. In ENM, communication and honesty is strongly emphasized. Everyone involved is well informed and gives their full consent. Consent in sexual encounters is sometimes defined as: “If it is not an enthusiastic yes, it is a no”. The same principle applies to Ethical Non-monogamy -- the “ethical” nature of the arrangement is lost if any party is misinformed or cohorced.
                </p>

                    There are many flavors of poly. Polyfidelity involves a group of people who chose to remain exclusive within their group. Open relationships place no limits on any member's sexual or romantic partners. Often, those who have a poly relationship orientation create their own custom agreement to fit the needs and desires of those involved. These relationship contracts, either informally agreed upon or debated and written down, can be renegotiated as the member's needs and desires change over time.

                <h2>Why am I Poly?</h2>

                <p>
                    Explaining why someone is poly might not be well suited for written argument. Any form of orientation (romantic, sexual, gender, relationship, etc) is best summed up as: “that’s just the way that I feel”. Rather than present an argument for why I am poly, this section outlines how I discovered that polyamory was even an option and tries to summarize what I have learned about polyamory over the last several months.

                <p>
                    I first found the term “poly” in an article on LGBTQ+ terms in the fall of 2020. This  lead me to an often cited 1997 book, “The Ethical Slut”. As I began reading through The Ethical Slut, I kept returning to one line:
                </p>

                <i>
                    "Imagine what it would feel like to live in an abundance of sex and love, to feel that you had all of both that you could possibly want, free of any feelings of deprivations of neediness."
                </i>

                </footer>

                <br />

                <p>
                    I had never before thought that having an abundance of love and affection was an option in romantic partners. It is difficult to put into words how liberating and beautiful I found the idea of a life where someone could have an abundance of wonderful people in their lives.

                <h2>How to be Poly</h2>

                <p>
                    Once I realized that my relationship orientation was poly, I was faced with a question: how does one have a healthy poly relationship? Learning how to have healthy relationships is hard. We learn through many years of personal trial and error; through observing the relationships of our peers; and through hours and hours of relationship cycles shown to us in books, movies, songs, and theater. Unfortunantly, 99.999% of these relationships are monogmous examples -- examples of healthy polyamourous relationships are incredibly rare.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I think one way to navigate poly relationships is to apply the same rules that apply to healthy friendships. Skills such as: establishing healthy boundaries; using active listening and effective communication (particularly “I” messages). 
                </p>

                <i>
                    "If you have a lover and a best friend who are not the same person, you’re already practicing many of the skills of sluthood as you manage each of their needs for intimacy, time, and affection. "
                </i>

                <br />

                <p>
                    While the monogamous relationship uses sexual fidelity as a major measuring stick, poly relationships judge their relationship based on the joy it bring to its members and the health of the relationship itself.
                </p>

                <br />

                <h2>What about Jealousy?</h2>

                <p>
                    Do poly people ever feel jealous?
                </p>

                <p>
                    Poly communities acknowledge feelings of jealousy. Rather than viewing jealousy as an insurmountable emotion, they view it as something to be acknowledged and addressed. Monogamous culture typically shows jealousy as a huge fight, full of personal insults and sometimes even physical violence. Poly communities treat jealousy just like any other emotions. It is expected that any relationship with produce a wide range of emotions, from the positive(joy, pleasure, excitement) to the negative (anger, jealousy. Anger in a mono relationship is a sign that something is wring, that we need to pause and discuss what the problem is. Poly people view jealousy as the same way; a relationship “check engine light”, a sign to pause, and discuss what is causing these feelings, and to ensure that everyone feels supported and that their needs are being met.
                </p>

                <p>
                    An additional note about poly is that it changes the economic of jealousy. In a fully monogamous group, if your partner shows an interest in another member, this is a direct threat to you -- a choice will have to be made and you could be the loser. In a fully poly community, if your partner shows interest in another member, there is significantly less reason for concern. After all, should your partner develop a relationship with this new partner, there would be very little incentive to cast you aside. After all, everyone wants more love and affection not less. If things are good between you and your partner, it seems unlikely that they would voluntarily chose to end your relationship without the cultural norm on monogamy. The only reason that they would chose to end their relationship with you is if they were unhappy in that relationship -- which would likely happen if they had no other partners, or 100 other partners.
                </p>

                <p>
                    For polyamorous groups, jealousy is seen as an emotion to acknowledge and work through. For those who find this hard to fathom, it should also be noted that in monogamous relationships, jealousy is often accompanied with the surprise and betrayal of cheating, something that will not be the case in a healthy poly relationship

                <h2>FAQ</h2>

                <p>
                    So can you still cheat?
                </p>

                <p>
                    Absolutely. Poly relationships often involve spoken or written relationship contract, outlining what everyone is and is not comfortable with. Breaking an agreement is just as serious a breach of trust as it is in a monogamous relationship.
                </p>

                <p>
                    So poly people have sex with everyone?
                </p>

                <p>
                    No. Poly people are normal people, with unique levels of sexual libido. A mono person might very well be more sexually active than a poly person. Poly people still only have sex and enter into relationship with those that they are attracted to. They might still be super picky.
                </p>

                    Won’t I get a bunch of diseases?
                </p>

                <p>
                    Again, poly people don’t necessarily have lots of sex. When they do, the emphasis on communication, means that they often have time to discuss and plan so safe sex practices before adding a new partner. They may well have safer sex than a monogamous person who makes it a habit of sleeping with strangers at the bar.
                </p>

                <p>
                    What about raising a family?
                </p>

                <p>
                    This is still a personal choice. A poly person could choose to have multiple romantic partners and raise a family with only one. Or they could choose any range of parenting arrangements (although custody and legal regulations are likely not in their favor). Good parents and bad parents are likely abundant in 2 parent or 10 parent households.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Can you really love more than one person?
                </p>

                <p>
                    This seems like an incredibly personal matter. Some people likely can. If you have had multiple partners over the years, one after the other, you likely had the capacity to love each individually. The love for each was likely very unique. You might be able to love all of those partners at once, but you also might not. This is very subjective. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    A central premise of polyamory is to acknowledge that love and affection are unlimited. Poly does acknowledge real constraints, typically: time and space. You may only have so many hours in the day to spend quality time with each lover. You may well encounter a limit there. Poly does however, think that love is not the limit.
                </p>

                    I probably did a pretty poor and inconclusive job explaining poly. Luckily there are a lot more comprehensive sources of poly learning. Here are a few of my favorites:
