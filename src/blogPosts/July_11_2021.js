                <h2>What is Poly?</h2>

                <p>
                    Poly (short for polyamory) is an umbrella term used to describe a wide range of Ethical Non-monogamous relationship styles. Ethical Non-monogamy (ENM) is any form of relationship where all parties agree to having multiple sexual and/or romantic partners. In ENM, communication and honesty is strongly emphasized. Everyone involved is well informed and gives their full consent. Consent in sexual encounters is sometimes defined as: “If it is not an enthusiastic yes, it is a no”. The same principle applies to Ethical Non-monogamy -- the “ethical” nature of the arrangement is lost if any party is misinformed or cohorced.
                </p>

                <p>
                    There are many flavors of poly. Polyfidelity involves a group of people who chose to remain exclusive within their group. Open relationships place no limits on any member's sexual or romantic partners. These are just two styles among many. Often, those who have a polyamorous relationship orientation create their own custom agreement to fit the unique needs and desires of those involved. These relationship contracts, either informally agreed upon or debated and written down, can be renegotiated as the member's needs and desires change over time.

                <h2>Why am I Poly?</h2>

                <p>
                    Explaining why someone is poly might not be well suited for written argument. Any form of orientation (romantic, sexual, gender, relationship, etc) is best summed up as: “that’s just the way I feel”. Rather than present an argument for why I am poly, this section outlines how I discovered that polyamory was even an option and tries to summarize what I have learned about poly over the last several months.

                <p>
                    I first found the term “poly” in an article on LGBTQ+ terms in the fall of 2020. This  lead me to an often cited 1997 book, “The Ethical Slut”. As I began reading through The Ethical Slut, I kept returning to one line:
                </p>

                <i>
                    "Imagine what it would feel like to live in an abundance of sex and love, to feel that you had all of both that you could possibly want, free of any feelings of deprivation or neediness."
                </i>
                <footer className="blockquote-footer">
                    <cite title="The Ethical Slut">The Ethical Slut</cite> (page 28)
                </footer>

                <br />

                <p>
                    I had never before thought that having an abundance of love and affection was an option in romantic partners. It is difficult to put into words how liberating and beautiful I found the idea of a life where someone could have an abundance of wonderful friends and partners.
                </p>

                <br />

                <h2>How to be Poly</h2>

                <p>
                    Once I realized that my relationship orientation was poly, I was faced with a question: how does one have a healthy poly relationship? Learning how to have healthy relationships is hard. We learn through many years of personal trial and error; through observing the relationships of our peers; and through hours and hours of relationship programing shown to us in books, movies, songs, and theater. Unfortunately, 99.999% of those relationships are monogamous -- examples of healthy polyamourous relationships are incredibly rare.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I think one way to navigate poly relationships is to apply the same rules that apply to healthy friendships. Skills such as: establishing healthy boundaries; using active listening and effective communication (particularly “I” messages), among many others, may help one create a healthy poly relationship. 
                </p>

                <i>
                    "If you have a lover and a best friend who are not the same person, you’re already practicing many of the skills of sluthood as you manage each of their needs for intimacy, time, and affection."
                </i>

                </footer>

                <br />

                <p>
                    While the monogamous relationship uses sexual fidelity as a major measuring stick, poly relationships judge their health based on the joy it brings to its members and the health of the relationship itself.
                </p>

                <br />

                <h2>What about Jealousy?</h2>

                <p>
                    Do poly people ever feel jealous?
                </p>

                <p>
                    Yes.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Poly communities acknowledge feelings of jealousy. Rather than viewing jealousy as an insurmountable emotion, however, they view it as something to be acknowledged and addressed. Monogamous culture typically portrays jealousy as a huge fight, full of personal insults and sometimes even physical violence. Poly communities treat jealousy just like any other emotions. It is expected that any relationship will produce a wide range of emotions, from the positive (joy, pleasure, excitement) to the negative (anger, jealousy, sadness). Anger in a mono relationship is a sign that something is wrong, that you need to pause and address some sort of issue. Poly people view jealousy in a similar way. Jealousy in a poly relationship could be thought of as a “check engine light”; a sign that something is wrong and further investigation is needed to ensure that everyone feels supported and that their needs are being met.
                </p>

                <p>
                    An additional note about poly is that it changes the economics of jealousy. In a fully monogamous group, if your partner shows an interest in another member, this is a direct threat to you -- a choice will have to be made and you could be the loser. In a fully polyamorous community, if your partner shows interest in another member, there is significantly less reason for concern. After all, should your partner develop a relationship with this other member, there would be very little incentive for them to cast you aside. After all, everyone wants <i>more</i> love and affection not less. If things are good between you and your partner, it seems unlikely that they would voluntarily chose to end a good thing. The only reason that they would chose to end their relationship with you, is if they were unhappy in that relationship on its own.
                </p>

                <p>
                    For polyamorous groups, jealousy is seen as an emotion to acknowledge and work through. For those who find this hard to fathom, it should also be noted that in monogamous relationships, jealousy is often accompanied with the surprise and betrayal of cheating, something that is not likely to be the case in a healthy poly relationship.
                </p>

                <br />
               
                <h2>F.A.Q.</h2>

                <p>
                    <b>Can you still cheat?</b>
                </p>

                <p>
                    Absolutely. Poly relationships often involve spoken or written relationship contracts. These contracts outline expectations for the group -- what everyone is and is not comfortable with. Breaking an agreement is just as serious a breach of trust as it is in a monogamous relationship.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <b>So poly people have sex with everyone?</b>
                </p>

                <p>
                    No. Poly people are normal people who happen to have a different relationship orientation. Like all groups, there are members with a wide range of sexual libidos. A mono person with a high libido might very well be more sexually active than a poly person with a low libido. Poly people still only have sex and enter into relationships with those that they are attracted to. Poly people might still be very picky.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <b>Won’t I get a bunch of diseases?</b>
                </p>

                <p>
                    Again, poly people don’t necessarily have lots of sex. When they do, the emphasis on communication means that they often have the opportunity to discuss their expectations for safe sex. They may well have safer sex than a monogamous person who makes it a habit of sleeping with strangers at the bar.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <b>What about raising a family?</b>
                </p>

                <p>
                    This is still a personal choice. A poly person could choose to have multiple romantic partners and raise a family with only one. Or they could choose any range of parenting arrangements (although custody and legal regulations are likely not in their favor). Good parents and bad parents are likely abundant in two-parent or ten-parent households.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <b>Can you really love more than one person at once?</b>
                </p>

                <p>
                    Some people likely can, though this seems like an incredibly personal matter. If you have had multiple partners over the years, one after the other, you likely had the capacity to love each individually. The love for each was likely very unique. Given the opportunity, you might have been able to love all of those partners at once... but then again maybe not. As someone who identifies as poly, I personally feel that this is something that I have the capacity for. Since I <i>do</i> lack the ability to read minds, I do not know how it feels to identify as mono, and therefore acknowledge that many people may not have the capacity to love more than one person at once.
                </p>

                <p>
                    A central premise of polyamory is to acknowledge that love and affection are unlimited. Poly does acknowledge real constraints, among others: time and space. You may only have so many hours in the day to spend quality time with each lover. You may well encounter a limit there. Poly people do, however, think that love is not the limit.
                </p>
